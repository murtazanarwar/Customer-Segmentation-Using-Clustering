I used customer segmentation as a primary application of unsupervised learning in this project. The idea behind customer segmentation is to divide a diverse customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, like purchasing behavior, interests, demographics, or other relevant factors. This segmentation allows businesses to better understand their customer base, enabling more personalized marketing and a stronger focus on each group’s specific needs.

To accomplish this, I applied K-means clustering, which is a fundamental clustering algorithm for handling unlabeled datasets. With K-means, I was able to group customers based on similarities within the data, creating clear segments that could be used to improve customer targeting. Each cluster represents a segment of customers with similar preferences or behaviors, providing insights that can be used to tailor product recommendations, create specialized marketing campaigns, and ultimately enhance customer satisfaction.

Through K-means clustering, I gained valuable insights into customer behavior patterns that aren’t immediately visible in raw data. By analyzing the attributes of each cluster, I was able to identify which groups are most likely to respond to specific marketing efforts or which segment may benefit from a new product. This approach not only aids in making data-driven decisions but also helps to optimize resource allocation by focusing efforts on the most promising customer segments.

Overall, using K-means clustering for customer segmentation allows businesses to engage more effectively with their users and fosters a deeper, more personalized connection with each segment, ultimately supporting long-term growth and customer loyalty.
